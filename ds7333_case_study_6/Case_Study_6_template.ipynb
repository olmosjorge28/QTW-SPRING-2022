    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this case study is to predict the detection of a new subatomic particle with high accuracy from a dataset with 7 million records.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "No information regarding the data in the case study was provided; the only stipulation given was to classify a binary variable representing \"the existence of a particle\" using a neural network. In terms of data detection of the binary classifier, 1 represents detection, and 0 represents non-detection. The client has advised that this is a massive amount of data best modeled with Neural Networks, and a high level of accuracy is critical.\n",

    "### Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are based on brain biology and stimulate the brain's function. Based on neuroscience, neurons are connected by axons to other neurons. This concept is applied in an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). An ANN comprises groups of \"neurons\" called layers. These layers are connected in a network to take inputs from the dataset, fit model weights to the inputs, and eventually produce outputs that can be used to classify a target variable. The layers between the inputs and the target outputs in a neural network are called hidden layers.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### TODO: Add image\n",
    "\n",
    "Physiologically, neurons work by firing signals only when a certain signal \"threshold\" is reached. This behavior is mimicked by ANNs. Any signal input below the threshold will not result in an output from the neuron, while any signal at or above the threshold will result in a constant output. Various activation functions are used to mathematically approximate how a neuron works. Activation functions are equations that determine the output of a neural network model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common activation functions are discussed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### TODO: Second Image\n",
    "Each neuron represents a regression in the neural network and calculates an output. A neural network is an ensemble of many regressors that will take the outputs of previous regressors as inputs. This results in a large ensemble of regression models.\n",

    "The stakeholders wanted our team to focus on creating a model that would predict the existance of a new particle with high accuracy above all, and the model interpretability was not a priority. With this mind our team decided on using an Artificial Neural Network to achieve a high accuracy model. Our has input layer of 28 neurons for each of the feature with X hidden layers and a single neuron output layer with a sigmoid activation function and a BinaryCrossentropy loss since our target variable is binary. The hidden layers used a ReLu activation, which was chosen for its non-linear characteristics that helps estimating non-linear functions. The team decided to have X neurons and X neurons...for each hidden layer respectively. \n",

    "In experimentations our best results were achieved with a batch size of 1000. This gave a large sample size limit uncessary fluctations, this gave the model the right balance between variance and bias. Additionally, the batch sizes were small enough to compute in memory, but not so small it would increase processing time dramatically. The team ran 100 epochs however after 30 epochs there was no further improvment was observed. "
