    "### Objective<a id='scope'/>\n",
    "This case study involves analyzing a ten-year study tracking diabetic patient readmission into hospitals. The goal of the analysis is to predict when diabetic patients are likely to be readmitted to a hospital based on the available data and determine if any of the provided factors are particularly indicative of a high chance of readmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction <a id='introduction'/>\n",
    "Diabetes is a common disease that affects the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels naturally. According to the American Heart Association [1], there are two main types of diabetes which involve issues with insulin. This hormone regulates how cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream. Type 1 diabetes describes the chronic form that is usually identified at a young age in which the body is unable to produce sufficient insulin. Type 2 diabetes, the most common condition, can arise later in life and occurs when the body develops an \"insulin resistance\" or its insulin production begins to diminish.\n",
    "Complications involving the effects of diabetes on the heart and circulatory system can lead to dire conditions that require hospitalization. Often patients are released from the hospital but may have to be readmitted soon after with recurring issues, causing additional strain on both the patients' livelihoods and the efficiency of the hospital. The data provided for this case study is requisitioned from a ten-year study on hospital readmissions of diabetic patients. This analysis aims to predict when diabetic patients are likely to be readmitted to the hospital after a visit given the provided information and if that readmission will occur in less than 30 days. Based on a predictive model, the most influential indicators of probable readmissions can be identified so that medical professionals can make better judgments on whether a diabetic patient is ready to be released. Since diabetes is estimated to affect 463 million people worldwide [2], any improvement in this regard would have far-reaching significant benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA <a id='eda'/>\n",
    "Two data CSV files are used for the analysis, \"diabetic_data.csv\" and \"IDs_maping.csv\". The “diabetic_data” dataset is based on the multi-year study of diabetes patients, and each row represents an individual hospital admission. The patients' information is systematically collected from the point of entry to that of discharge. It can be broadly classified into a few categories:\n",
    "Personal information\n",
    "•\tThe admission situations and conditions\n",
    "•\tThe laboratory tests conducted\n",
    "•\tThe physician's diagnosis\n",
    "•\tThe treatments and medications\n",
    "•\tThe discharge conditions\n",
    "This dataset contains 50 features and 101766 rows, including the response variable readmission information. In the diabetic data file, the team identified missing data. Following are a few observations:\n",
    "•\tThe response variable is a bit unbalanced 89:11 split. \n",
    "•\tThe imbalance was also observed in the male and female samples.\n",
    "•\tCollected data did show more samples from the Caucasian race. However, the ratio of the patient taking diabetic medication vs. total patients within the race is very similar (range from 74% to 80%).  Hospitals are typically required by state law to collect demographic information like race and ethnicity.  The 1964 Civil Rights Act allows hospitals to collect this data to ensure no discrimination in care.\n",
    "•\tPair plot distribution of continuous variables did not show any obvious correlation among continuous variables.\n",
    "The team looked at data in the \"ID_mapping.csv\" file. This file contains the ID for multiple categorical variables and its brief description. The team found some missing values like NULL, Not Available, unknown/Invalid, and Not Mapped during the data exploration of the ID_Mapping dataset. NaN replaced these missing values in the ID_Mapping dataset. Then Id_Mapping information was merged with the \"diabetic_data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods <a id='methods'/>\n",
    "The objective of our analysis is to classify diabetes patients who have the highest risk of being re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days using logistic regression modeling. L2 regularization was used to prevent overfitting and maintain model performance.  The team observed that L2 is faster and more efficient to run than L1 with this dataset that had a large number of dummy coded variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics used to evaluate model performance were percision and recall.  To balance percision and recall, we used the F1 score.  **** define F1 **** \n",
    "\n",
    "One school of thought presents an argument that the higher recall should be sought as the readmission must be prevented at all costs. There is no free lunch as the tightening of one side will force the other to bear the cost that they should not be. In that line, another idea presented is to have the optimum point at intersection between the precision and the recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train and Test Data Split <a id='Train and Test Data Split'/>\n",
    "The response variable is a bit unbalanced with 89 – 11 splits. So, Stratified-data split with 70/30 split between train and test set.  Stratified data splitting ensures that the groups are balanced since the dataset is unbalanced.  Dataset was split in training and test set before imputation. After imputation, the continuous variables were scaled to ensure high magnitude variables were not influencing the outcome more than low magnitude variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missing Values <a id='missing-values'>\n",
    "No missing value was observed in any continuous variable. All the missing values were observed in categorial features. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The challenge encountered with this data is the missing values. There were missing values observed in Id_mapping files. Missing values in the Id_mapping table were replaced with NaN. NaN values were substituted in the diabetic data file. Then missing values were mitigated as stated in the table above. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Team will investigate whether these missing values have any internal correlation or dependency. The heatmap do not show any overlap and correlation with the missing values.\n",
    "For diagnosis codes, the columns diag_1, diag_2, and diag_3 ICD code ranges were leveraged to reduce the categories. \n",

    "The team reviewed the data in detail after addressing the missing values. Features that are not meaningful such as encounter_id, patient_nbr, examide, and citoglipton are removed from the analysis. encounter_id and patient_nbr are id codes and will not add value to the model. examide, and citoglipton variables have all zeros.\n",

    "### Logistic Regression Modeling <a id='Logistic Regression Modeling'/>\n",
    "Logistic regression is a classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome based on the set of independent variables. Logistic regression is used for the analysis when working with the binary target variable, i.e., dichotomous, or categorical in nature; in other words, if it fits into one of two categories (such as “yes” or “no”, “pass” or “fail”, 0 or 1). The response variable used for this analysis also has dichotomous data, so the team decided to use Logistic Regression to analyze the diabatic data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Baseline Model:\n",
    "There were no missing values in the continuous variable, so the team built the baseline model using continuous variable only with Logistic Regression.  The team utilized the base model to assess the value of adding multi-level categorical variables as well as how the data looked without dummy coding or imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second Logistic Regression model was made using all the variables. This dataset was built after imputing missing values. The Logistic Regression model was built using penalty of “l2”, C value of “1”, and class_weight as “balance”. The team chose balanced class_weight to deal with the imbalance of the target variable. This option balanced how the model was predicting negative and positive classes.\n",
