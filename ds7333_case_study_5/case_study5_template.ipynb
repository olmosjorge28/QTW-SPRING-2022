    "## Objective:\n",
    "The goal of this case study is to build a Firewall classification model to automatically allow or deny access requests in real time with a high level of accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "This case study is about the management of firewall traffic. Cyber security consists of all the technologies and practices that keep computer systems and electronic data safe. A firewall is one of the most critical components in supporting big corporations to protect their data. The challenge offered to the team was to build a classification model that can automatically allow or deny the access request based on the features of the incoming request. A firewall is a hardware or software filter that authorizes access based on a certain set of pre-established rules. These rules are based on multiple aspects of packet data like their source, destination, content, protocol, and other data characteristics. When the network is significantly large, and policies are complicated, manual cross-check may be insufficient, inefficient, and ineffective in detecting anomalies. An automated model based on machine learning and high-performance computing methods is leveraged to detect anomalies to strengthen the firewall. To achieve this, firewall logs are analyzed, and the extracted features are fed to a set of machine learning classification algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cybercrimes are increasing every day, which makes it critical that organizations build a robust system to ensure CPI (Customer Personal Information) and other confidential information is kept secure. Firewalls are one of the most critical tools to safeguard the network. Firewalls are like fencing to keep trespassers away and not allow unauthorized access to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olmosjorge28/QTW-SPRING-2022/main/ds7333_case_study_5/Firewall.png\" />   \n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency and effectiveness of the firewall are judged by its accuracy and speed to identify malware and other suspicious activities. The firewall implementation can be done by hardware, software, and cloud. It carries out its function by filtering information at the application layer (proxy server) or permitting (or blocking) based on state, port, or protocol. Next-Generation Firewalls conduct deep packet inspection (beyond port/ protocol inspection). The most advanced firewalls are Unified Threat Management (UTM), which integrate multiple methodologies like stateful inspection, deep packet inspection, and Antivirus. The firewalls can provide advanced threat detection and mitigation by correlating ports, protocols, and/or suspicious behaviors. [1]\n",

    "The provided dataset contains 65,532 rows and 12 columns. It includes the ports, bytes, and packet information along with elapsed time. The dataset will need no imputation as there are no missing values. The ‘Action’ response column identifies the requests that were Allowed or Denied. ‘Action’ with a designation, \"deny\", \"drop\", or \"reset-both\" was categorized as Denied and assigned a value of \"0\" (27,892 requests) and Allowed requests were assigned as \"1\" (37,640 requests). The Dataset is relatively balanced per the barchart below. However, the team decided to use stratified splitting for training and test in an abundance of caution. Also, the dataset will be scaled to bring the values into acceptable ranges for faster, more efficient modeling.\n",

    "SVM creates decision boundaries with a margin of separation for classification.  Points on one side of the boundary are classified as Allowed, and points on the other side of the boundary are classified as Denied.  Only the points near the decision boundaries and misclassifications are used to determine where the boundaries are ultimately placed.  In this way, SVM is well suited to handle this “gray area” of classification where the two classes are more similar.  These boundaries can be linear or nonlinear (i.e. linear, poly, rbf, sigmoid).  Also, SVM is resistant to the effect of outliers as long as the outliers are on the correct side of the boundary.\n",

    "Due to the large number of rows in the dataset, SGD implementation will leverage a “partial fit” training approach to loop through the dataset in smaller batches to improve the training efficiency (both time and memory). SGD is a method that can reduce memory when working with datasets of vast sizes that overwhelm available computing resources. \n",

The team attempted this and discovered that data would grow exponentially from 12 columns to over 27,000. The team dropped the encoded dummy variable proposal as it took a very long time to process the using SVM and SGD. The processing time is one of the critical measures along with the accuracy. Also, the team found that SVM and SGD algorithms are able to handle these categorical variables as continuous variables and still achieve consistent classification with a high accuracy.   \n",

    "The accuracy obtained from the model could be considered very high at 99.9% for both the training and test sets.  However, depending on how often the firewall has to deal with these requests, that may not be good enough for real-world application. If these requests were coming in at over 1000 per day, that would mean that 1-2 would be incorrectly classified, leading to an important blocked request or an unfortunate malicious attack getting through the firewall.  The model could be further tuned such that more bad requests are blocked, but this would result in blocking more legitimate requests.\n",

    "Methods used in this case study could be effective with High-Performance Computing (HPC) with multi-core processors to produce more comprehensive and accurate models. Also, more diligence can be done to reduce stochastic gradient descent to obtain minimum loss. The larger volume of data will also help enhance the learning leading to better performance of firewalls. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quick convergence of these models in training could indicate that only a few important features and values contribute to the classification. Exploring the data showed that there were a few consistent variable values that always lead to a denied request, so if these are identified quickly in training, the rest of the data likely contributes minimal benefit to classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewing other classification algorithms, including Naive Bayes, kNN, Decision Table, and HyperPipes may enhance the model. Based on the article by Erden Ucar & Erkan Ozhan, “ The Analysis of Firewall Policy Through Machine Learning and Data Mining,” published on May 17, 2017, KNN has shown some outstanding results.  However, this would likely be a slow and inefficient model to predict in real time.   \n",
